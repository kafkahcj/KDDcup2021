1ï¼Ž	How to run AE/VAE in our project?
You can just run the main.py.
- The time series residual results for all files will be output in the file fold test_residual as txt format;
- The reconstruction image compared with original data will be output in the file fold model_result;
- The check point and best model for each file will be output in the file fold model_save(we have put the CNN-AE model for final output in the google drive,if you download it and put it in the model_save file fold, the program will load the model to predict);
